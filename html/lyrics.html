    I don’t believe that I can stay here
    And watch them vilify my blood
    I don’t believe that you are with me
    It’s so beneath you, gazing up

    I won’t kneel, I won’t bow
    If you’re there now, strike me down
    Strike me down, strike me down
    Oh, you’ve got nothing

    There is none higher than this blood
    And I won’t serve anyone
    No there is nothing above
    And I don’t serve anyone, anyone
    There's nothing above

    Deep in my heart, a disbeliever
    Only inviting in the truth
    You’re in my heart, my disbeliever
    As holy horror crushes you

    I won’t kneel, I won’t bow
    No one is there to strike me down
    Strike me down, strike me down
    Except the faithful

    There is none higher than this blood
    And I won’t serve anyone
    No there is nothing above
    And I don’t serve anyone, anyone

    I don’t believe that I can stay here
    And watch them vilify my blood
    I don’t believe that I can stay here
    And watch them vilify your love, my love

    I won’t kneel, I won’t bow
    If you’re there, God, strike me down
    Strike me down
    You won’t

    There is none higher than this blood
    And I won’t serve anyone
    No there is nothing above
    And I don’t serve anyone, anyone
    There’s nothing above
